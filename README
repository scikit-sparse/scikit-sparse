This is scikit-sparse, a companion to the scipy.sparse library for
sparse matrix manipulation in Python. It provides routines that are
not suitable for inclusion in scipy.sparse proper, usually because
they are GPL'ed.

NOTE:
  This library is solid and works well, but no longer actively
  developed. Please let us know if you wish to take over development.

So far it just contains a wrapper for the CHOLMOD library for sparse
cholesky decomposition. Further contributions are welcome!

The wrapper code contained in this package is released under a
2-clause BSD license, as per below. However, this applies only to the
original code contained in this package, and NOT to the libraries
(e.g., CHOLMOD) which it uses. These libraries are generally
licensed under less permissive licenses, such as the GNU GPL or LGPL,
and users of this package are responsible for determining what
requirements these licenses impose on their usage. (The intent here is
that if you, for example, buy a license to use CHOLMOD in a commercial
product, then you can also go ahead and use our wrapper code with your
commercial license.)
